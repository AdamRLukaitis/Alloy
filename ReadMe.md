Alloy
-----

Alloy is a system allowing bare metal software to coexist with a Linux kernel on a multicore processor (e.g. Raspberry Pi 2).
This allows hard real-time response on separate cores while coexisting and coroperating with a Linux core.

For example a hard real-time core monitoring and controlling GPIO lines while passing data to the Linux core for communication and control over the network.
